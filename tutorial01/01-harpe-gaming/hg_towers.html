<h2>Rule an Ancient City</h2>
<p><b>Towers and Temples </b> is the winner of the 2017 Palmer 
	Medal for Best New Simulation Board Game. 
	Players adopt role cards of characters from ancient 
	Greece and Rome in an attempt to manage 
	the administration of a city. Each role provides 
	a different ability and strategy. However, 
	one role card belongs to a deadly assassin and players 
	must be constantly aware of betrayal 
	and double-cross. This card game provides a ton 
	of enjoyment and can handle up to eight players 
	and expansion packs available for larger parties.
	<br />
	<br />
	This is a nicely balanced game, where each player must 
	carefully choose his or her roles and 
	the strategies can quickly change with the turn 
	of a card. However the level of randomness is 
	just right and cunning and resourcefulness can 
	overcome bad luck (if given time.) I do not 
	recommend this game unless there are at least 4 
	players; less than that reduces the intrigue 
	and some of the game appeal.

<h2>Highly Recommended</h2>
<p>
	Towers and Temples is a great game. The balance is 
	just about perfect and each player must 
	carefully choose roles each turn. Even though the 
	strategic possibilities are nearly endless, 
	the game is simple to learn. The replay value is 
	high and gets even better when you replace 
	some of the cards with new cards available in the 
	expansion packs.

<h2>	Great Strategic Board Game</h2>
<p>
	We tested Towers and Temples with everything from 2 
	to 6 players and we can strongly 
	recommend the game. The different phases of the 
	game are interesting and intriguing, from
	bluffing and stealing to site construction and planning. 
	With the variety of cards and 
	scenarios, no two games are ever quite the same. It's 
	a great introduction to the world of 
	strategic board games and role playing.

<h2>	An Incredible Game</h2>
<p>
	The artwork on the cards and the board is excellent and one of the best around. As for play, this game offers lots of strategy, and there are tough decisions to make every turn. It's not only important to select the character that increases your chances for scoring, but also to anticipate the characters the opponents are likely to select, and then hedge against their availability. This causes a lot of unpredictability and deep strategic thinking. However, it can still be played at a more basic level for younger users.
	<br />
	<br />
	We had a lot of fun with this game and rate it as Best in its Class. Highly recommended.

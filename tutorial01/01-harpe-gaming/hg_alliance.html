<h2>Decide the Fate of the World</h2>
<p>
	The world is a war.<b>Alliance </b>challenges you and your opponents to decide 
	the outcome. As one of the world powers 
	battling for supremacy you must lead your country's
	 military drive; but you can't do it alone. 
	You have to form alliances and then betray your 
	allies before they betray you!
	<br />
	<br />
	Decide where to strike, when to strike, and the intensity
	 of the strike. Will it be a bombing 
	raid, an offshore missile barrage, or an invasion 
	with land forces and tanks? Plan your attack, 
	move into enemy territory with your forces and win 
	the conflict.
	<br />
	<br />
	The economic destiny of your nation is also at stake. 
	Buy armaments and develop secret 
	weapons from your country's economic funds and 
	natural reserves, but be sure to save 
	something for the future.

<h2>Tedious and Confusing</h2>
<p>
	The list of war simulation games is long. All of them 
	share similar features including the 
	formation of temporary Alliance and battles simulated 
	through random draws of a deck or the 
	roll of the die. Alliance offers very little that 
	is new or innovative in that regard.

	We found the game to be too drawn-out and confusing. 
	In fact, I dare say we spent more time 
	reading and rereading the rule book than actually 
	playing the game. If you want to read a 
	book on war, we suggest Sun Tzu.

<h2>Decent Game but Many are Better</h2>
<p>
	Alliance is a good war simulation game. We found the 
	game play to be robust and engaging. The 
	rules are long and drawn out but, for anyone with 
	experience in this class of board games, there 
	is little there that's unexpected or difficult. We 
	think the battle simulation cards are some of 
	the best we have encountered.

	All of that being said, the competition for this type 
	of game is fierce. There are a lot of 
	established titles with loyal clients. We're not 
	exactly sure where Alliance fits in with 
	that group. It's a good game, but not good enough 
	to draw our attention away from games like 
	Battle Tested and Global Conflict.

<h2>Fun and Challenging</h2>
<p>
	Alliance is fun game and is sure to appeal to 
	war game enthusiasts. We think it offers several new 
	ideas that we're surprised have not been utilized in other simulation games. The card system and the 
	investment options give the game a "real world" feel.
	<br />
	Things We Liked
	<ul>
		<li>Variety of Battle Scenarios</li>
		<li>Flexible Rules and Setup</li>
		<li>Detail and Historical Accuracy</li>
		<li>Wealth of Expansion Packs</li>
	</ul>
	Things We Hated
	<ul>
		<li>Long and Complicated Rule Book</li>
		<li>Setup takes too Long</li>
	</ul>
	This is a great game for anyone 16 years or older. Younger players may have trouble with the rules and may be bored
